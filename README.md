# circlib

Python library for creating and editing circloO levels. In the future, it will also allow to interact with the circloO API.

### This library is undergoing total rewrite, so the documentation is not up to date.

# Installation

The library isn't hosted on PyPi, so install it directly from github, like so:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/qaptivator/circlib.git
```

# Contribution

First of all, read the glossary, I wouldn't want confusion in the code.
Use pull requests to merge changes, and feel free to contribute! It would be highly appreciated.

## Glossary

- level code - level stored in a string, which you can see by exporting a level. this is what is read by the library, and then generated back again.
- line - a line of text, which is extracted by separating level code by newlines.
- parts (line parts) - all of the strings and numbers generated by splitting a line with a space.
- code (line code) - the first line option, which specifies the option's type. it can be an object, header, etc.
- numerics, strings - in CircloO, order of line parts matters for each data type.
  so if you have two numerics and a string, you can swap the places of strings and numerics: you just need to keep the order of numerics and strings indiidually correct.
  example: `ic 'io' 1385 2063 1` same as `ic 1385 'io' 2063 1` BUT not same as `ic 2063 1385 'io' 1`.
- options - an object holding arguments for a function, or holding generic properties of things. example: all lines share same properties so there is LineOptions.
  plus it allows to better document data.
- deserialize - convert a line/line parts into instance of an object.
- serialize - convert instance of a object to level code.
- object - a visible thing existing in the level. something like code for collectable sound effect is NOT an object, but a collectable IS.
- header - metadata attached to the object. it doesn't describe properties of an object, it describes properties of the level.
- object property (?) - a line which describes properties of an object, neither an object or a header (exception for comments (lines starting with '/')).
- type - do not use types as referring to object's code, or as a object itself.
  refer to it as 'object' (about an instance) or 'code' (inside of level code).
  calling 'c' or 'fixed_cirlce' a type is INCORRECT (ive done this many times myself here but i wanna change this)
- moveable - a moveable object, DO NOT USE MOVABLE.
- rotateable - only rotateable.
